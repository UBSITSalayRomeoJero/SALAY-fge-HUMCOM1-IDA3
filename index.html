    <h4><strong>How can IT and Computer Science students contribute to this goal?</strong></h4> <!-- HEADING 1 -->

    <p><mark>IT and Computer Science students</mark> can help contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by <mark>connectivity</mark> because it can help vulnerable communities on their path to peace and resilience. 
        Peace is best practiced by individuals integrated into thriving communities, and communities thrive when their members exchange among themselves and communicate with those outside. This implies that, today, in this age of social media, peace and connectivity condition each other.
        Connectivity means that people and communities have the skills, the capacity and the will to interact and engage in respect-driven dialogues, that they can access the resources to do so, and that they have the technology to help bridge physical and cultural distances. 
        Another is that We train groups of young people from conflict- and violence-affected communities in conflict resolution, entrepreneurship and ICTs so they can become peace makers and mediators and develop educational and economic projects; we also equip them with technology so they can reach out to each other, form friendships and connections, and brainstorm their responses to crises in real time. We cannot achieve all these if we disconnect technology from learning, and this relates particularly to SDG 4 on quality education for all. 
        Multiple issues are at stake here. Firstly, people must learn how to use technology and information in ways appropriate to their needs and aspirations. The relevance of ICTs is not just in access or even in basic command skills: ICTs are truly relevant if they help us innovate in our daily lives. 
        Technological innovation is successful when it supports social innovation.</p>
